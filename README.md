# Bushra KB’s Cryptography Algorithms in Python
### bushra-kb-py-cryptography

Welcome to the repository for implementing various cryptographic algorithms in Python. This project aims to provide clear and concise implementations of several well-known cryptographic algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**
2. **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**
3. **RSA Algorithm (Rivest, Shamir, Adleman Algorithm)**
4. **Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)**
5. **Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES)**
6. **International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)**
7. **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)**
8. **SHA-256**
9. **MD5**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bushra-kb-crypto-algorithms.git
cd bushra-kb-crypto-algorithms
```
### Usage
Each algorithm is implemented in its own python file. You can run the scripts directly to see the algorithms in action. For example, to run the AES implementation:
     ```cd aes
        python aes.py```
